Why Declarative Programming?  Declarative programming is a style of programming that focuses on what the program should accomplish rather than how to achieve that goal. This approach offers several key benefits.  #### Properties of Declarative Languages  1. Simple Program Semantics: One of the main principles of declarative programming is "What You See Is What I Mean" (WYSIWIM). This means that the code you write closely represents the logic or intention behind it. It makes it easier to understand what the program does at a glance.  2. Higher Understandability and Verifiability: Since declarative languages emphasize clarity in expressing logic, programs are often easier to read and understand. This leads to better verification, meaning itâ€™s simpler to check that the program works as intended.  3. Referential Transparency: In declarative programming, functions produce the same output given the same input, regardless of where they are used. This property makes reasoning about code much easier, as you can replace a function call with its result without changing the program's behavior.  4. Closer to Mathematics: Declarative programming often resembles mathematical expressions. This similarity allows programmers to use mathematical reasoning to develop and analyze their code, making it more intuitive for those with a mathematical background.  5. Computation by Values, Not by Effects: In declarative programming, computation focuses on the values produced rather than the side effects that occur during execution. This means that the code is less likely to produce unexpected results, improving reliability.  6. Everything is Deterministic: Finally, programs written in a declarative style are typically deterministic. This means that they will always produce the same output for the same input, making them predictable and easier to debug.  ### Conclusion  In summary, declarative programming offers a clear and intuitive way to express logic, leading to better understandability, verifiability, and reliability in software development. By focusing on the desired outcome rather than the
