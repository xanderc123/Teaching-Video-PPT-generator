Why Declarative Programming?  Declarative programming is a style of programming that focuses on what the program should accomplish rather than how to achieve it. Here are some key properties and benefits of declarative languages:  1. Simple Program Semantics: In declarative programming, the code often reads like a description of the desired outcome. This is known as "What You See Is What I Mean" (WYSIWIM). It makes understanding the program easier because the code closely matches our intentions.  2. Higher Understandability and Verifiability: Since declarative languages describe what should happen, they are generally easier to read and understand. This clarity also helps in verifying that the program behaves as expected, reducing the chances of bugs.  3. Referential Transparency: In declarative programming, expressions can be replaced with their values without changing the program's behavior. This property, known as referential transparency, makes it easier to reason about code and ensures predictability.  4. Closer to Mathematics: Declarative programming often resembles mathematical expressions and logic. This similarity means programmers can apply mathematical reasoning to their code, making it easier to formulate and solve problems.  5. Computation by Values, Not by Effects: In declarative languages, the focus is on computing values rather than describing steps to achieve those values. This approach leads to simpler and more maintainable code.  6. Everything is Deterministic: In declarative programming, given the same input, the program will always produce the same output. This predictability is crucial for debugging and testing, as it eliminates surprises during program execution.  In summary, declarative programming offers a clear, mathematical approach to coding, enhancing understandability and reliability. By focusing on "what" rather than "how," it simplifies the programming process and promotes better software development practices.
